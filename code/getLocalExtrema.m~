%%Detecting Extrema
% inputs
% DoG Pyramid - size (size(im), numel(levels) - 1) matrix of the DoG pyramid
% DoG Levels
% PrincipalCurvature - size (size(im), numel(levels) - 1) matrix contains the curvature ratio R
% th_contrast - remove any point that is a local extremum but does not have a DoG response magnitude above this threshold
% th_r - remove any edge-like points that have too large a principal curvature ratio
% output
% locs - N x 3 matrix where the DoG pyramid achieves a local extrema in both scale and space, and also satisfies the two thresholds.
